        <header><h1>Space Journey (Group)</h1></header>
        <p>The goal was concept development for a fictional space program lead by the Danish National Space-program.
            <br>
            <br>
            What we came up was a fancy space restaurant with a hotel. 
            I was in charge of making the menu site, the logo and a poster.
            <br>
            <br>
            Since the target group for our case were rich people. We wanted to empathize that they would get an excellent experience that they paid for.
            <br>
            <br>
            I made the poster trying to put weight on those factors.
            <br>
            <br>
            While my menu site I had focus on displaying the food in an appetizing way.
