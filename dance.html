        <header><h1>Dance Dance Dance 2.Part (Group)</h1></header>
        <p>In the start of this project we got handed another groups dance project which was swing in our case.
            We got all their documents and what their thoughts were and what direction they wanted to take it.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            My role in this project was what we called head of design. I did not make all the decisions on how it should look. I just made suggestions and visualized our ideas.
